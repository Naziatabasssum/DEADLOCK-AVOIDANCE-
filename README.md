Explanation:

The processes must anticipate the maximum number of resources required as they enter the system, which may be done in a reasonable amount of time.
In contrast to interactive systems, this method maintains a fixed number of processes.
A specific number of resources must be available to distribute in order for this technique to work. The algorithm would not function if a gadget broke and went unexpectedly offline.
The method will incur overhead costs since it must be invoked for each process when there are several processes and resources.
